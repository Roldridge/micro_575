## tidyverse packages stuff 1

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## along with creating objects

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

a <- 1
b <- 2
a <= b

ls()

rm(list = ls())
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
