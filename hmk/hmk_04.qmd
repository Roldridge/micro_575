## Hmk_04

loading tidyverse because i have to and forgot about it and wondered why my stuff wouldn't work

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
data <- read_csv("fake_data.csv")
```

making the graph because thats the homework

```{r}
ggplot(data) + 
  geom_violin(aes(x=make, y=mileage, fill=make))
```
this is good because it shows what proportion of each make is at a particular mileage. Also, its colorful because that looks nice.
